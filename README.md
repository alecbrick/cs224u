# Alec Brickner's CS224U Repository

Forked from the code for [the Stanford course](http://web.stanford.edu/class/cs224u/)

Code related to the project is primarily in tf\_trnn.py, tf\_lifted\_trnn.py, and run\_trnn\_exp.py.
The notebook lifted\_tree\_rnns.ipynb is also relevant, though it was mostly a place for experimentation.
Most of its functionality resides in run\_trnn\_exp.py (which is also a bit of a testing ground).
